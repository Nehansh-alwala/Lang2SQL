📢🚀 Excited to share my latest AI project: Lang2SQL!

🤖 Lang2SQL is an LLM-powered assistant that turns plain English into SQL queries — all through a friendly chat interface.
 Built with Streamlit, Gemini AI, and designed to make exploring and updating your data as easy as having a conversation.

🌟 What is Lang2SQL?

Lang2SQL is an intelligent assistant that makes working with databases as simple as chatting:
✅ Upload your data: SQLite files, CSVs, or Excel spreadsheets
✅ Ask questions or give commands in natural language (e.g., “Show me all users who joined last month”, Delete employee who are working hybrid..)
✅ Get SQL instantly: The app uses Gemini AI to translate your prompt into real, executable SQL
✅ Run & preview: Results are displayed live as tables; schema changes and data updates happen on the fly
✅ Database schema viewer: Always see your current database structure (tables & columns) in the sidebar
✅ Action history: View what operations you (or the assistant) performed recently
✅ Download updated database: After making changes, download the complete updated SQLite database with one click
All in one clean, chat-style interface built with Streamlit.


🧠 Why build it?

Writing SQL can be tedious – and intimidating for non-developers.
Lang2SQL helps bridge that gap by:
- Turning natural language into working queries
- Helping analysts & engineers move faster
- Letting anyone – even non-technical teammates – ask questions and get real data answers
- Keeping visibility into the database schema so you know what’s there and what changed
It’s like having a friendly AI data analyst that understands your language and speaks SQL fluently.

🔧 How it works (tech stack):
🧩 Streamlit – for an interactive, live web app
🔍 Gemini 2.0 Flash – generates SQL queries from your prompts
🛢 SQLite & Pandas – to store, query, and show data
